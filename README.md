## Introduction

This online booking service allows customers to browse and search for the movies they want. Customers can cancel a reservation and modify the ticket options, such as available time slots and rooms. The system will use a user login page that saves the customers' list of purchased tickets so they can view their tickets in detail.
A blend of the spiral model and the waterfall incremental approach is employed. Each iteration of the project's progression will be validated and verified by the stakeholders.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default:

`src`: the folder to maintain sources
`lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
